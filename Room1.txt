 The glass shatters with a loud crash. Almost instantly, a magical alarm blares — glowing runes light up along the wall.
 → Go to 4: Elemental Encounter


Pick the lock — (Silent and skilled)
 With deft fingers, you quietly click the lock open. The door swings in silently. No alarms, no sign of resistance.
